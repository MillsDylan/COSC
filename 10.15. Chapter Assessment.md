**The textfile, travel_plans.txt, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary.   
Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable num.**
```
with open ('travel_plans.txt', 'r') as fp:
    num = len(fp.read())
 ``` 
 **We have provided a file called emotion_words.txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable num_words.**
 ```
 with open ('emotion_words.txt', 'r') as fp:
    w = fp.read()
    r = w.split()
    num_words = len(r)
 ```
 **Assign to the variable num_lines the number of lines in the file school_prompt.txt.**
 ```
 with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as fp:
    lines = fp.readlines()
    num_lines = len(lines)
 ```
 **Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.**
 ```
 with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as fp:
    beginning_chars = fp.read(30)
 ```
 **Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.**
 ```
 three = []
with open ('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as fp:
    for i in fp.readlines():
            three.append(i.split()[2])
```
**Challenge: Create a list called emotions that contains the first word of every line in emotion_words.txt.**
```
emotions = []
with open ('emotion_words.txt', 'r') as fp:
    for i in fp.readlines():
            emotions.append(i.split()[0])
```
**Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars.**
```
with open ('travel_plans.txt', 'r') as fp:
        first_chars = fp.read()[:33]
```
**Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.**
```
p_words = []

    lines = fp.read()
    for i in lines.split():
            if 'p' in i:
